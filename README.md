## Why Learn Pandas

If you are a data scientist who uses Python there are two ways to approach pandas - something you can't avoid or something to enjoy. This repo is about the second path.

I consider myself an expert at pandas, but only because I have spent the past 6 years grinding through code that used pandas.

Why do I use pandas so much? Well it's really really useful. You can think of pandas as a container for data, and well data is everywhere.

Why was it aa grind. Well the API is huge, and often confusing and there are more than one way to do things.
